# hw12-Employee-Tracker
homework 12 employee tracker 


# Purpose of application
The purpose of this application is to provide a CLI platform to keep track of the employees, departments, and roles. It also allows the user to add an employee, a department, and a role. With this app you can also update a role and assign that updated role to a specific employee. 

# My experience 
Once the sql was made and JOINing all of the tables to collaborate together to produce a working application, it was fun playing around with the artist's effects you can do in the terminal.
